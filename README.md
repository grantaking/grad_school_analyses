# grad_school_analyses
A compilation of the most useful Python and R code that I wrote throughout most of my classes in grad school. This is mainly for my own storage, but also, for others that would like to see what was taught during my graduate school program, feel free to look! All code in this repo is my own.

Note: analysis for my Practicum project is not included, as it is confidential. I've also removed all assignment descriptions and input data (although outputs are sometimes available).
