# grad_school_analyses
A compilation of the coding and analysis that I did for most of my classes throughout grad school. This is mainly for my own storage, but also, for others that would like to see what was taught during my graduate school program, feel free to look!

Note: analysis for my Practicum project is not included, as it is confidential. I've also removed the homework assignment descriptions.
